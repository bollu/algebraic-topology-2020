#### Pairing and Universal coefficients

We can interpret the universal coefficients theorem as a pairing \(H^k \times H_k \to \mathbb{Z}\) which is non-degenerate up to torsion.

### Geometry of cohomology

* We assign weights to edges that intersect given (unions of) arcs and curves.
* __Co-cycles:__ transversal arcs match.
